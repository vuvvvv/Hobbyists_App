HawyeenApp – Hobby Community
Hawyeen combines attractive design with smooth animations to deliver an enjoyable and immersive user experience. Your privacy comes first: share hobbies safely on the map using a smart location obfuscation algorithm that shows only your area, not your exact location. Public data includes name, hobbies, and gender only. All other data remains encrypted and secure. Discover new hobbies and connect with an active, safe community. Currently available in Saudi Arabia, with more cities coming soon.
